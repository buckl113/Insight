Description: # Insight
        This is a library compiled from multiple Jupyterhub image analysis projects. 
        These projects include a camera program, an image alignment program, a point selection program, and a paint program.
        ## INSTRUCTIONS:
        download or copy & paste "Insight.py"
        
        In Jupyter Notebooks:
        
        cell [1] 
        
            !pip3 install mpld3 --- AFTER RUNNING ONCE, DON'T RUN AGAIN OR CLONE
        
        cell [2] 
        
            # only needs to be run after kernel has restarted
            import Insight
            
        cell [3] 
        
            # in order to run alignment, type this (and insert 1 or 2 url strings to change the images)
            Insight.alignment()
            
        cell [4] 
            
            # in order to run points, type this (and insert a url string, point color, and/or point radius to change from default)
            Insight.points()
        
        cell [5]
        
            # after running points and selecting points, to see the point coordinates, run this
            Insight.point_coords(xcoords,ycoords)
        
        cell [6]
        
            # in order to run paint, run this (and insert a filename string to change the background image)
            Insight.paint()
            
        cell [7]
            
            # after running paint and snapping a photo of your drawings, run this to view your drawings
            Insight.image_plot(image)
            
        cell [8]     
            
            # in order to run camera, run this
            Insight.camera()
            
        cell [9]
        
            # after running camera and snapping a photo , run this to view your picture
            Insight.image_plot(image)
